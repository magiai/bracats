Bracats Checker
===============

Overview
--------

The purpose of this repository is to check skills of candidates applying to Orba for a position of Frontend Developer.
If you are here, you probably want to work with us :-).

Bracats Checker is a simple application built using JavaScript ES6.
It allows user to input a string of brackets (only them) and check if the order of brackets is valid.

- Instead of using classic brackets (`(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`), application is using special "cat" brackets (aka "Bracats"): `cat`, `tac`, `CAT`, `TAC`, `cAt`, `tAc`.
- A string of brackets is considered valid if all open brackets are matched with their corresponding closed bracket. For example: `cattacCATTACcAttAc` and (`CATcattacTAC`) would be considered valid, while `catTAC`, `cAtcattActac` and `catcatcattactac` would be considered invalid.
- An empty string is considered valid.

In current state the application is correctly set up, but implemented algorithm is wrong.

Recruitment task description
----------------------------

1. Fork this repository.
2. Install application locally.
3. Don't worry about older browsers. Your solution should support newest Firefox and Chrome.
4. [*Optional*] For bonus points, do worry about other browsers. Set up webpack (or any bundler of your choice) with transpilation to ES5. You can also add some modern CSS extension, e.g. Sass (_Note: we already have Babel config for jest._)
5. Implement Bracats validation in `check` method placed in `public/js/check.js` file.
6. Apply frontend changes so the application looks like on mockups. PSD file with the whole design can be found in `docs/project.psd`. Apply your own proposal for focus and hover effects style.
7. Write unit tests to get more points. Two of them are already in `tests/check.test.js` file.
8. Make your code SOLID to get even more points.
9. When you're done, create a Pull Request with your changes.

Installation and running the application
----------------------------------------

You can install application on your local environment or using Docker.

### Using Docker

You need to have Docker and Docker-Compose installed on your local machine.

1. Clone your forked repository (master branch) locally.
2. CD to project root and run `docker-compose up`.
3. Application will be accessible by the following address: `http://localhost:8000/`.
4. Unit tests can be executed by running the following command: `docker exec -it <CONTAINER_NAME> yarn test`.
